  While it's common knowledge that equatorial regions are generally warmer, it's not commonly known exactly why that is, since there are so many factors which affect the weather.

  This visualization presents a visual comparison of the humidity of a location to its latitude.  The goal is to confirm whether there is a correlation between the humidity and latitude, and whether it is a likely cause for these regions' unusual heat.

<strong>Analysis: </strong> There is no clear correlation between humidity and latitude.
