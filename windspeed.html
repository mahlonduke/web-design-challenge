  While it's common knowledge that equatorial regions are generally warmer, it's not commonly known exactly why that is, since there are so many factors which affect the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  This visualization presents a visual comparison of the windspeed of a location to its latitude.  The goal is to confirm whether there is a correlation between the wind speed and latitude, and whether it is a likely cause for these regions' unusual heat.
</p>
<strong>Analysis: </strong> There is no clear correlation between the wind speed and latitude.
